# Anka-bot
Anka-bot is a 5 month project with the objective of creating a spider robot, able to go on different types of surfaces/slopes.

The conception was enterily done with the SolidEdge software. 
3D printing, laser cutting and assembly of the robot were done in the workshops that the school made available to us.

In this repository you can find all files of the conception, some photos of the final robot, and a video of the robot.
